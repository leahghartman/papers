# Academic Resources

A collection of academic papers, articles, and other resources that I plan to read or have read, with a focus on computational plasma physics, scientific computing, and high-performance computing.

I've also included a notes directory underneath each subject area directory to summarize important takeaways and to help me better understand the material.
